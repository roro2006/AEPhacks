- Solar heating (time/date-dependent)
- Conductor resistance modeling
- Real conductor libraries

### 6. Learning Mechanism

**Successful Actions:**
```python
if outcome == 'successful' and impact_score > 0.5:
    pattern.confidence += 0.05
    pattern.occurrence_count += 1
    Update average severity
```

**Failed Actions:**
```python
if outcome == 'failed':
    thresholds['loading']['caution'] -= 1.0  # More conservative
```

**Adaptive Thresholds:**
- System learns optimal operating points
- Failed actions → lower thresholds
- Successful patterns → higher confidence
- Continuous improvement

### Production Considerations

1. **API Key Security**
   - Store in environment variables
   - Never commit to version control
   - Rotate periodically

2. **Monitoring**
   - Check agent status endpoint regularly
   - Monitor prediction accuracy
   - Track pattern learning progress

3. **Scaling**
   - Current design: single instance
   - For distributed: add database persistence
   - Consider Redis for state sharing

4. **Backup**
   - Patterns can be serialized to JSON
   - Historical data should be persisted
   - Action logs for audit trail

## Usage Examples

### Basic Monitoring
```python
import requests

response = requests.post('http://localhost:5000/api/agent/monitor', json={
    'weather': {'ambient_temp': 35, 'wind_speed': 1.5}
})

result = response.json()
print(f"Grid Status: {result['grid_status']}")
print(f"Issues: {result['issues_detected']}")
```

### Predictive Analysis
```python
forecast = [
    {'ambient_temp': 38, 'wind_speed': 1.2, 'sun_time': 15},
    {'ambient_temp': 40, 'wind_speed': 1.0, 'sun_time': 16}
]

response = requests.post('http://localhost:5000/api/agent/predictions', json={
    'weather_forecast': forecast
})

predictions = response.json()
for alert in predictions['alerts']:
    print(f"Alert: {alert['title']}")
```

### Learning from Actions
```python
requests.post('http://localhost:5000/api/agent/learn', json={
    'action': {
        'action_type': 'load_reduction',
        'description': 'Reduced load on L48',
        'grid_state_before': {'avg_loading': 95.0}
    },
    'result': {
        'outcome': 'successful',
        'impact_score': 0.9,
