# Load and Gen Scaling
# 
# Load and gen changes based on time of day, day of the week, and weather. You can see some government data
# (https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=42915) for some fun data.
# 
# The load changes through the day provide another interesting problem to solve if we solve everything else. This
# requires a lot of work with a solver and manipulating the model.


# Scaling in our Hawaii40 model
# 
# We can use a sine wave to approximate load variations through the day if we are:
# - min/max at 6pm/6am
# - values in model are nominal - peaks are 10% below/above nominal.
# 
# Remember that as we increase the load, we also must increase then generation. The solver doesn't automatically
# change the generation values to meet the new load. If you don't increase the generation, this "missing power" will
# magically come from the slack bus or cause the solver to fail.
